          <h1>KiwiCam Terms of Service</h1>
          <p>Last updated: <span id="lastUpdated">November 15, 2025</span></p>

          <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
          <p>
            By accessing or using KiwiCam (“the App”), you agree to be bound by these Terms of
            Service (“Terms”). If you disagree with any part of these terms, then you may not access
            the App.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Use License</h2>
          <p>Permission is granted to download and use KiwiCam for personal, non-commercial use only, subject to the following restrictions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You may not use the App for any unlawful purpose or to solicit others to perform unlawful acts.</li>
            <li>You may not violate any local, state, national, or international law or regulation.</li>
            <li>You may not transmit any worms or viruses or any code of a destructive nature.</li>
            <li>You may not infringe upon or violate our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>3. Subscriptions</h2>
          <p>
            KiwiCam offers optional auto-renewing subscriptions that unlock additional transformation
            credits and premium functionality. By purchasing a subscription, you agree to the terms in
            this section in addition to the rest of these Terms of Service.
          </p>

          <h3>3.1 Available Plans</h3>
          <p>
            We currently offer six auto-renewable subscription options. Listed prices reflect the United
            States App Store in USD; Apple will display and charge the equivalent amount in your local
            currency, which may vary because of exchange rates, taxes, or regional pricing adjustments.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>KiwiCam Lite Monthly</strong> – 1 month for $1.99 USD per month.</li>
            <li><strong>KiwiCam Standard Monthly</strong> – 1 month for $5.99 USD per month.</li>
            <li><strong>KiwiCam Pro Monthly</strong> – 1 month for $9.99 USD per month.</li>
            <li><strong>KiwiCam Lite Annual</strong> – 1 year for $19.99 USD per year.</li>
            <li><strong>KiwiCam Standard Annual</strong> – 1 year for $49.99 USD per year.</li>
            <li><strong>KiwiCam Pro Annual</strong> – 1 year for $99.99 USD per year.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>3.2 Auto-Renewal &amp; Billing</h3>
          <p>
            Subscriptions renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the
            end of the current period. Your Apple ID account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours
            prior to the end of the current period at the price shown in the app at the time of renewal.
            After purchase, the current subscription period cannot be cancelled and you retain access to
            premium features until the period ends.
          </p>

          <h3>3.3 Managing or Cancelling Your Subscription</h3>
          <p>
            You can manage your subscription, view renewal dates, or turn off auto-renew at any time by
            opening the Settings app on your iOS or iPadOS device, tapping your Apple ID at the top,
            selecting <em>Subscriptions</em>, and choosing KiwiCam. You can also open the App Store, tap
            your profile icon, go to <em>Subscriptions</em>, and make changes there. Turning off auto-renew
            takes effect after the current billing period concludes.
          </p>

          <h3>3.4 Free Access &amp; Trials</h3>
          <p>
            Every new KiwiCam account can process three photos for free before the paywall appears. This
            complimentary usage does not convert into an auto-renewing subscription and expires once the
            three transformations are redeemed. At this time we do not offer a time-limited free trial for
            subscriptions; if we introduce one, the duration and eligibility will be clearly disclosed in the
            app. Any unused portion of a future trial, if offered, would be forfeited upon purchasing a
            subscription.
          </p>

          <h3>3.5 Billing, Refunds, and Taxes</h3>
          <p>
            Payment is charged to your Apple ID account at the time of purchase confirmation. Apple handles
            billing, taxation, and refund requests for KiwiCam subscriptions. All refund requests must be
            submitted through Apple Support; KiwiCam cannot issue refunds for purchases made via the App
            Store. Depending on your region, applicable taxes may be added to the displayed price by Apple.
          </p>

          <h3>3.6 Privacy</h3>
          <p>
            Subscription management and transaction data are processed through Apple and our in-app purchase
            provider. Please review our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> to learn how we handle personal data in
            connection with your subscription.
          </p>

          <h2>4. User Content</h2>

          <h3>4.1 Photo Transformations</h3>
          <p>
            When you upload photos to KiwiCam, you retain ownership of your original images. By using our AI
            transformation services, you grant us a license to process and transform your images to provide the
            requested service. This includes transmitting your photos to our third-party service providers
            (Replicate API) which uses Google’s Nano Banana Model to perform the AI transformations.
          </p>

          <h3>4.2 Third-Party Processing</h3>
          <p>
            You acknowledge and agree that your photos will be processed by third-party services (Replicate API
            and Google’s Nano Banana Model) to provide the transformation functionality. By using KiwiCam, you
            consent to the transmission and processing of your images by these third-party services in accordance
            with their respective privacy policies and terms of service.
          </p>

          <h3>4.3 Prohibited Content</h3>
          <p>
            You agree not to upload, post, or transmit any content that is illegal, harmful, threatening, abusive,
            harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, or otherwise objectionable. We reserve the right to refuse
            service to anyone who violates these terms. You are responsible for ensuring you have the right to
            upload and transform any images you submit.
          </p>

          <h2>5. AI-Generated Content Disclaimer</h2>
          <p>
            KiwiCam uses artificial intelligence (Google’s Nano Banana Model via Replicate API) to transform your
            photos. The results are AI-generated and may not always produce perfect or expected results. We do not
            guarantee the accuracy, quality, or suitability of transformed images for any particular purpose. AI
            transformations are probabilistic in nature and results may vary.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Third-Party AI Services:</strong> The AI transformations are performed by Google’s Nano Banana Model,
            which is accessed through Replicate API. We do not control the AI model’s behavior, output quality, or
            processing methods. Any issues, inaccuracies, or limitations in the transformations are subject to the
            capabilities and limitations of these third-party AI services.
          </p>

          <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
          <p>
            The App and its original content, features, and functionality are owned by KiwiCam and are protected by
            international copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, and other intellectual property laws.
          </p>

          <h2>7. Service Availability</h2>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to withdraw or amend the App, and any service or material we provide, at any time
            without notice. We will not be liable if, for any reason, all or any part of the App is unavailable at
            any time or for any period. KiwiCam depends on third-party services (Replicate API and Google’s
            infrastructure) for its core functionality, and service may be interrupted or unavailable due to issues
            with these third-party services, which are beyond our control.
          </p>

          <h2>8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
          <p>
            THE APP IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. WE MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
            REGARDING THE APP’S OPERATION OR THE INFORMATION, CONTENT, OR MATERIALS IT CONTAINS.
          </p>

          <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
          <p>
            In no event shall KiwiCam, its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates be liable
            for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages resulting from your use of the
            App.
          </p>

          <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>
          <p>
            You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless KiwiCam from any claims, damages, obligations, losses,
            liabilities, costs, or expenses arising from your use of the App or violation of these Terms.
          </p>

          <h2>11. Changes to Terms</h2>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will
            provide at least 30 days’ notice prior to any new terms taking effect.
          </p>

          <h2>12. Apple Standard EULA</h2>
          <p>
            If you access KiwiCam through the Apple App Store, your use of the app is also governed by Apple’s
            Licensed Application End User License Agreement (“Apple Standard EULA”). Please review the Apple Standard
            EULA at

            In the event of a conflict between these Terms and the Apple Standard EULA, the Apple Standard EULA will
            apply to the extent required by Apple.
