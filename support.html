          <p>Need help restoring a subscription or unlocking premium styles? Start here.</p>

          <h2>How to Restore Your Purchases</h2>
          <p>
            If you’ve previously purchased a KiwiCam subscription (Lite, Standard, or Pro) and need to
            restore it—for example, after reinstalling the app or switching devices—follow these steps:
          </p>

          <h3>Step 1: Open Settings</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Launch the KiwiCam app.</li>
            <li>Tap the gear icon (⚙️) in the top-right corner of the main screen.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Step 2: Restore Your Purchases</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Scroll to the “Purchases” section.</li>
            <li>Tap the “Restore Purchases” button.</li>
            <li>The app will verify your subscription with Apple using the Apple ID you used to purchase it.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Step 3: Wait for Confirmation</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Your subscription status will be restored automatically if you’re signed in with the same Apple ID that was used for the original purchase.</li>
            <li>Your subscription tier (Lite, Standard, or Pro) and remaining monthly credits will be restored.</li>
            <li>You should see your subscription active again within a few seconds.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Important Notes</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>You must be signed in to the same Apple ID that was used to purchase your subscription.</li>
            <li>If you’re switching to a new device, make sure you’re logged into the same Apple ID on both devices.</li>
            <li>Restoring purchases only works for active subscriptions or subscriptions that have been purchased in the past (if they’re still valid).</li>
            <li>If you have an active subscription but it’s not restoring, ensure you’re using the same Apple ID account.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>If the restore fails, try signing out and back into your Apple ID in your device Settings.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have an active internet connection.</li>
            <li>
              If problems persist, contact us at
              <a href="mailto:maxfroehlich@gmx.net">maxfroehlich@gmx.net</a> and include the email address associated
              with your Apple ID account.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Alternative Method</h3>
          <p>
            You can also restore purchases from the paywall screen. When the paywall appears, look for a “Restore” button
            at the bottom of the paywall.
          </p>

          <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

          <h3>How does KiwiCam work?</h3>
          <p>
            KiwiCam uses advanced AI technology (Google’s Nano Banana Model) accessed through Replicate API to transform
            your photos into various styles. Simply upload a photo, choose a transformation style, and the AI will process
            it on secure third-party servers to create a photorealistic transformed version that is delivered back to you.
          </p>

          <h3>Are my photos stored securely?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes, we take your privacy seriously. Photos are processed securely through Replicate API using Google’s Nano
            Banana Model. Images are temporarily stored on our servers (up to 30 days) and on Replicate’s infrastructure
            (typically 24–72 hours) during processing. You can delete your images from our systems at any time through the
            app. Please see our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for more details about third-party data handling.
          </p>

          <h3>How long does image transformation take?</h3>
          <p>Most transformations are completed within 10–30 seconds, depending on image complexity and server load.</p>

          <h3>Can I use transformed images commercially?</h3>
          <p>
            Transformed images are created using AI technology. While you retain rights to your original photos, commercial
            use of AI-generated content may be subject to local laws and regulations. Please use your transformed images
            responsibly.
          </p>

          <h3>What photo formats are supported?</h3>
          <p>
            KiwiCam supports common image formats including JPEG, PNG, and HEIC. Images should be clear and well-lit for
            best transformation results.
          </p>

          <h3>Is the app free to use?</h3>
          <p>
            KiwiCam offers three free pictures. Afterwards you have three different subscription options to choose from.
