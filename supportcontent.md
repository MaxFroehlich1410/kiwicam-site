### How to Restore Your Purchases

If you've previously purchased a KiwiCam subscription (Lite, Standard, or Pro) and need to restore it—for example, after reinstalling the app or switching devices—follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Open Settings

* Launch the KiwiCam app
* Tap the gear icon (⚙️) in the top-right corner of the main screen

#### Step 2: Restore Your Purchases

* Scroll to the "Purchases" section
* Tap the "Restore Purchases" button
* The app will verify your subscription with Apple using the Apple ID you used to purchase it

#### Step 3: Wait for Confirmation

* Your subscription status will be restored automatically if you're signed in with the same Apple ID that was used for the original purchase
* Your subscription tier (Lite, Standard, or Pro) and remaining monthly credits will be restored
* You should see your subscription active again within a few seconds

#### Important Notes:

* You must be signed in to the same Apple ID that was used to purchase your subscription
* If you're switching to a new device, make sure you're logged into the same Apple ID on both devices
* Restoring purchases only works for active subscriptions or subscriptions that have been purchased in the past (if they're still valid)
* If you have an active subscription but it's not restoring, ensure you're using the same Apple ID account

#### Troubleshooting:

* If the restore fails, try signing out and back into your Apple ID in your device Settings
* Make sure you have an active internet connection
* If problems persist, contact us at [maxfroehlich@gmx.net](mailto:maxfroehlich@gmx.net) and include the email address associated with your Apple ID account

#### Alternative Method:

You can also restore purchases from the paywall screen. When the paywall appears, look for a "Restore" button at the bottom of the paywall.
