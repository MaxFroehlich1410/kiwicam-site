### How does KiwiCam work?

KiwiCam uses advanced AI technology (Google's Nano Banana Model) accessed through Replicate API to transform your photos into various styles. Simply upload a photo, choose a transformation style, and the AI will process it on secure third-party servers to create a photorealistic transformed version that is delivered back to you.

### Are my photos stored securely?

Yes, we take your privacy seriously. Photos are processed securely through Replicate API using Google's Nano Banana Model. Images are temporarily stored on our servers (up to 30 days) and on Replicate's infrastructure (typically 24-72 hours) during processing. You can delete your images from our systems at any time through the app. Please see our [Privacy Policy](https://kiwicam.site/privacy-policy) for more details about third-party data handling.

### How long does image transformation take?

Most transformations are completed within 10-30 seconds, depending on image complexity and server load.

### Can I use transformed images commercially?

Transformed images are created using AI technology. While you retain rights to your original photos, commercial use of AI-generated content may be subject to local laws and regulations. Please use your transformed images responsibly.

### What photo formats are supported?

KiwiCam supports common image formats including JPEG, PNG, and HEIC. Images should be clear and well-lit for best transformation results.
